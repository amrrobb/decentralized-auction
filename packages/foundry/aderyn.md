# High Issues

## H-1: Arbitrary `from` passed to `transferFrom` (or `safeTransferFrom`)

Passing an arbitrary `from` address to `transferFrom` (or `safeTransferFrom`) can lead to loss of funds, because anyone can transfer tokens from the `from` address if an approval is made.  

- Found in contracts/DecentralizedAuction.sol [Line: 173](contracts/DecentralizedAuction.sol#L173)

	```solidity
	        IERC721(nftContract).safeTransferFrom(seller, bidder, tokenId);
	```

- Found in contracts/DecentralizedAuction.sol [Line: 180](contracts/DecentralizedAuction.sol#L180)

	```solidity
	        IERC721(nftContract).safeTransferFrom(seller, receiver, tokenId);
	```



# Medium Issues

## M-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

- Found in contracts/DecentralizedAuction.sol [Line: 36](contracts/DecentralizedAuction.sol#L36)

	```solidity
	contract DecentralizedAuction is IERC721Receiver, Ownable {
	```

- Found in contracts/DecentralizedAuction.sol [Line: 198](contracts/DecentralizedAuction.sol#L198)

	```solidity
	    function withdrawFee() external onlyOwner {
	```



# Low Issues

## L-1: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

- Found in contracts/YourContract.sol [Line: 2](contracts/YourContract.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity >=0.8.0 <0.9.0;
	```



## L-2: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

- Found in contracts/DecentralizedAuction.sol [Line: 2](contracts/DecentralizedAuction.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity 0.8.20;
	```

- Found in contracts/YourContract.sol [Line: 2](contracts/YourContract.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity >=0.8.0 <0.9.0;
	```



# NC Issues

## NC-1: Functions not used internally could be marked external



- Found in contracts/DecentralizedAuction.sol [Line: 230](contracts/DecentralizedAuction.sol#L230)

	```solidity
	    function onERC721Received(address, /*operator*/ address, /*from*/ uint256, /*tokenId*/ bytes calldata /*data*/ )
	```

- Found in contracts/YourContract.sol [Line: 45](contracts/YourContract.sol#L45)

	```solidity
	    function setGreeting(string memory _newGreeting) public payable {
	```

- Found in contracts/YourContract.sol [Line: 70](contracts/YourContract.sol#L70)

	```solidity
	    function withdraw() public isOwner {
	```



## NC-2: Constants should be defined and used instead of literals



- Found in contracts/YourContract.sol [Line: 52](contracts/YourContract.sol#L52)

	```solidity
	        totalCounter += 1;
	```

- Found in contracts/YourContract.sol [Line: 53](contracts/YourContract.sol#L53)

	```solidity
	        userGreetingCounter[msg.sender] += 1;
	```



## NC-3: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

- Found in contracts/YourContract.sol [Line: 24](contracts/YourContract.sol#L24)

	```solidity
	    event GreetingChange(address indexed greetingSetter, string newGreeting, bool premium, uint256 value);
	```
