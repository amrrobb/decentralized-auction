2. **Auction Creation**: Users have the ability to commence auctions for their NFTs, determining the initial price and duration.
3. **Bid Participation**: Bidders engage in ongoing auctions by submitting bids within the designated timeframe.
4. **NFT Ownership Claim**: The successful bidder can assert ownership of the NFT subsequent to triumphing in the auction.

## Actors

1. **Auctioneer/Seller**: The individual who initiates an auction for their NFT by calling the `createAuction` function. The auctioneer sets the starting price and duration of the auction. Additionally, as the seller, they own the NFT being auctioned and ultimately transfer ownership to the winning bidder.

2. **Bidder**: Users who participate in ongoing auctions by placing bids on NFTs they are interested in acquiring. Bidders interact with the platform by calling the `placeBid` function.

3. **Winner**: The bidder who submits the highest bid within the auction's time frame becomes the winner of the auction. The winner can claim ownership of the NFT by calling the `claimNft` function.
